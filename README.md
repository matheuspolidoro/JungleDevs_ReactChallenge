## Author notes
It was great acomplish this test using NextJs for the first time. I did intend to project this landing page with efforts in kind a 'pure-ish' javascript and css. Besides, tried to use the native tools offered by Next environment and by javascript itself, reducing third party libraries.

Surely it has a lot of points to be improved, as uncoupling more the components and looking more carefully for perfomance hacks.

I'm grateful for the opportunity.
