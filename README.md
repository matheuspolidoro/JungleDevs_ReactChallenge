## Author notes
It was great to accomplish this test using Next.js and SEO for the first time applying best practices syntax. I did intend to project this landing page with efforts in kind a 'pure-ish' Javascript and CSS. Besides, tried to use the native tools offered by Next environment and by Javascript itself, avoiding third party libraries.

Surely it has a lot of points to be improved, as uncoupling more the components and looking more carefully for perfomance hacks.

I'm grateful for the opportunity.
